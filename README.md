# Project 
Memory Card game is the second project of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. Main focus is JavaScript & The DOM manipulation. We are provided with some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project and have to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file, as only the shuffle cards function is provided.

# Memory Game
Memory Game, also known as Concentration, Match Match, Match Up, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. Memory Game can be played with any number of players or as solitaire. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well. The scheme is often used in quiz shows and can be employed as an educational game.
