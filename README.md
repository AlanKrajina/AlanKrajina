# Memory Game
The project is part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree and here is the starter code. It is provided some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I have to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file, as only the shuffle cards function is provided. I have included sound and cards animations.

# Project Overview
There are 16 cards on a deck, click on the cards to reveal icons and see if you find a match.

If the cards match, they will remain open. If they don't match, they will flip over. Try again until you find the 8 matches.

You can play here.

# Rating
The rating is base on the number of moves made to complete the game:

Less than 16 moves, you will receive a 3 stars.
Between 16 and 25, you will receive a 2 stars.
More than 25, you will receive a 1 stars.
